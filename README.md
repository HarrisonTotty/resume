# My Resume

The following repository contains the sources used to compile my CV, resume, and cover letters. My resume is essentially a heavily modified varient of [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), where the majority of the complexity is moved from LaTeX to Jinja2 templating via [tmpl](https://github.com/HarrisonTotty/tmpl). In this way, all of the data associated with my abilities is contained within YAML files, and then translated accordingly into Jinja2 and then LaTeX.
